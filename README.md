LAMINA1 

From July 25 — August 26, 2024 all Lamina1 Beta-testers are eligible to claim LL1 tokens in our first official Mainnet airdrop. Read below for a full overview and step-by-step guide on how to receive your rewards.


Attention Beta-testers. The time has finally come. As thanks for all your hard work in building, testing, creating on, and contributing to the network, the Lamina1 core team and Open Metaverse Foundation are releasing our first-ever Mainnet airdrop: Airdrop Beta (ADb).

In this drop, 32.5 million LL1 rewards tokens will be distributed to 65,000 community members who built with us in Testnet and Betanet. As long as you claim these tokens during the dedicated claim window: July 25 –August 26, 2024 these tokens will be deposited directly into your new Mainnet Wallet on lamina1.com, and will begin to unlock into usable, liquid L1 as soon as the claim window is up.

Read below for details on rewards eligibility, the airdrop claim process, our criteria/calculations behind the airdrop, and more. By the time you finish reading, you should be armed with everything you need to know to get your tokens and how to use them as the Lamina1 platform expands and evolves.

Airdrop Claim Window
As stated above, the airdrop claim window will run one month, from July 25–August 26, 2024. Community members must claim their tokens during this window to receive their rewards, and can do so via a new, limited-edition ‘Airdrop’ tab we just released in the LAMINA1 Hub.


Any token rewards that go unclaimed after this date will be put back into an airdrop rewards pool managed by the Open Metaverse Foundation, and redistributed in a series of follow-up drops targeted to new members and Zealy quest participants after the initial claim period is over.

Airdrop Beta (ADb) Eligibility
In order to receive rewards tokens in this airdrop, you must have had an active account on the Lamina1 Discord and/or Betanet with at least one transaction on it on https://hub.lamina1.com prior to the cut-off dates below:

April 26, 2024: Community Rewards
April 18, 2024: Platform Rewards
Community rewards refer to rewards linked to your Discord and Zealy activity during the LAMINA1 Testnet and Betanet period. Relevant activity includes: Discord join date, badges, messaging activity, Zealy leaderboard status, and participation in key LAMINA1 initiatives such as AMAs, workshops, creator competitions, etc.

Platform rewards refer to rewards linked to your Hub/on-chain activity during the LAMINA1 Betanet before 4/18. Relevant activity includes: # of Betanet transactions, # of items published, # of items transferred, # of usernames reserved, # of smart contracts launched, and smart contract activity.

That means if you joined the Discord or participated in quests after 4/26, you will not be eligible for this airdrop, and will have to wait until Hubmania rewards begin to drop later this summer. Similarly, if you launched a smart contract or made any on-chain transactions after 4/18 on the LAMINA1 Betanet, you will have to wait to claim these rewards during later drops as well.

Approximately 16 million LL1 tokens will be distributed as “community rewards” for the ADb airdrop, while the remaining 16 million LL1 will be distributed as “platform rewards.” Additionally 595,750 LL1 will be allocated to community members from the Foundation for “bonus pack” rewards based on participation in key builder, creator, and on-chain initiatives druing the Beta period. This time around, just over 50,000 LAMINA1 community members were eligible for rewards.

For more on how airdrop rewards were calculated for this latest drop, see the Behind-the-Scenes: Airdrop Beta (ADb) Data Model section below.

How to Claim Your Airdrop via the LAMINA1 Hub — One Account; Same Sign-in/Address

If you followed our instructions while onboarding and signed into the LAMINA1 Mainnet using the same login method (e.g. social account, email address, Metamask wallet) you used during Betanet, you should have the same exact alphanumeric, or 0x address linked to your account.

This will make your life easier, because it will automatically forward any platform rewards you earned during Betanet directly into your new Mainnet account.

To check to see if your addresses match between Mainnet and Betanet, log on to https://betanet.hubdemo.lamina1.com/ and find your address in your dashboard (click the eye if you set a username), then compare it to your new Mainnet address at https://lamina1.com/ by copying and pasting it from your top nav.

If your account is automatically eligible for platform rewards, you will see a screen that looks like this in the following step, overviewing your platform rewards allocation and asking you to verify that the account you’re currently signed into is Mainnet address you’d like to forward those rewards to:


If this is the account you’d like to claim your rewards with, continue on by selecting “Keep Address,” which will move you forward in the flow to check for any community rewards you may be eligible for.

If it’s not, learn how to change the address your rewards are going to in the “How to Claim Your Airdrop via the LAMINA1 Hub — Multiple Accounts; Different Sign-in/Address” section below.

If you were not active in Betanet, or if you have a different address in Mainnet than you did on Betanet, you will instead get a screen that looks like this:


If you don’t think you are eligible for any platform rewards (for example, you were active on Zealy/Discord, but never made a LAMINA1 Hub account during Betanet), simply continue on in the flow to check Discord for community rewards.

If you do think you’re eligible for platform rewards, but you did not set up your new address according to our initial onboarding instructions (or are one of a handful of community members who experienced a random address change during the transition from Mainnet to Betanet), scroll down to the following section for instructions on how to manually link your past Betanet activity to your new Mainnet account.

Once you’ve finished linking up any platform rewards, you’ll be directed to the second step in the airdrop claim flow, which will help you check for any community rewards you may be eligible for based on your activity on Discord, Zealy, and other off-chain initiatives during the Betatest period.


This page will instruct you to copy your Hub address, then open up Discord to a dedicated #airdrop-adb channel that will explain to you how to use our new claim bot to link your community rewards to your Hub account, and allow you to prompt it in the channel.



Prompt the bot in this channel by entering the command ‘/airdrop’ into your message line. Wait a moment, let the bot populate, click on it, then press enter.

If properly typed, inputting this command will pull up a new bot modal you can click on and interact with directly to begin linking and claiming your rewards before returning back to the Hub.

If you have just one account you’re claiming with, you only really need to use/pay attention to the two blue buttons:

Set Community Rewards Destination: [Required] Input the Mainnet address you want to receive the rewards tokens you are eligible for based on your Discord/Community activity. Here is where you paste the address you just copied over from the Hub to link your Discord activity to that account. When you press this button and input an address, you will get a small test drip of L1 sent to that Mainnet account. Check the “Wallet” tab to see if you received the drip before continuing and signing over your rewards to the Hub. This command can be called up to 5 times.
Submit Claim to Mainnet Hub: [Required] Submits the information you input via the button above back to your designated Mainnet account on the LAMINA1 Hub, where you’ll complete your Airdrop claim. Make sure you get the confirmation below before going back to your Mainnet Hub account and clicking “Continue” in the claim flow on the platform.
The two grey buttons are optional, and mainly designed for users who need to forward rewards or claim rewards from multiple accounts. For more information, see the “How to Claim Your Airdrop via the LAMINA1 Hub — Multiple Accounts; Different Sign-in/Address” section below.

NOTE: Every LAMINA1 Discord member who joined prior to April 26, 2024 and sent at least one message should be eligible for some kind of community reward. Exceptions to this rule include community members who were caught cheating, sharing codes, breaking server rules, etc. during the Beta test period.

If you need assistance with claiming or using the bot, feel free to reach out to a moderator on the #airdrop-support channel anytime.

Once you’ve checked both your platform and community rewards, you’ll be taken to a page that shows you the total rewards you have checked for and can claim into your account.


If everything looks good, hit “Complete Claim” then pay a small transaction fee to claim your tokens. You should have received enough free tokens from the claim bot to pay for gas to complete the process.

NOTE: If you are using a Metamask-connected account to claim your rewards, you may need to remove any previous Lamina1 networks you were connected to (e.g. Betanet, Fuji) from your Metamask, then reload the page to complete your claim.

Once successfully claimed, airdrop rewards tokens will appear in your Wallet tab as locked LL1 below the liquid/usable L1 you have in your account. You can begin unwrapping these rewards tokens into liquid L1 when LL1 unlocking starts and staking goes live on the platform. Stay tuned.


If you believe that your airdrop is not right based on your past activity, you can request a review of your airdrop allocation by clicking the link on the dropdown at the bottom of the page. Airdrop Appeals will be reviewed regularly by the Lamina1 core team throughout the airdrop claim period.

You can return to this flow as many times as you’d like during the claim window, however, most community members should only have to interact with it once.

Again, if you need assistance with claiming, feel free to reach out to a moderator on the #airdrop-support channel anytime.

How to Claim Your Airdrop via the LAMINA1 Hub — Multiple Accounts; Different Sign-in/Address
If, for some reason, your Betanet address is different from your Mainnet address, or if you have multiple Betanet accounts you believe might be eligible for rewards, you will have to complete a few additional steps on the LAMINA1 Betanet Hub first to forward airdrop rewards to your new Mainnet account before completing your claim.
